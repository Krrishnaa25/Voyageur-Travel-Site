For locally hosting the website on your machine open this project folder in your code editor, go to the terminal and follow these steps:
1. For navigating to the frontend folder 
```sh
cd frontend
```
2. For intalling all the npm dependencies needed 
```sh
npm install
```
Start another terminal and follow the same steps for the backend folder as well, also replace the MONGO_URI with your own Mongodb URI in the index.js located in the backend folder.
Then run the following command in both the terminals to host the website locally on your machine: 
```sh
npm start
```
